# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 20, 2018 (Learn the basic of HTML)
##### How to write code properly and indentation and know what is the meta tags.

**Today's Progress**: My first day of 100 Days of Code. I learn the basics of HTML and how to write code properly.

**Thoughts:** It's good to learn how to write code properly because when I was working I thought my HTML code is good but when I read some articles like in the down below, I have so many bad practices, that's why i'm so happy the I learn the best way and the clean way to write HTML code properly.

### Day 1: August 21, 2018 (Learn the basic of HTML)
##### How to use header, main, footer and aside

**Today's Progress**: I learn how to organize my file and folder structure to my web page. I also learn how to use <header>, <main>, <footer>, and <aside> and what is the purpose of these syntax. I use these syntax to specify my header, content, footer, and aside to my web page and also I add img folder to save all my images and use it to my web page.

**Thoughts:** <header>, <main>, <footer> is the main semantic element inside the body. <header> specifies the header of a document. It contains branding and navigation <main> specifies the main content of the document. <footer> specifies the footer of a document. It contains some navigation link, social medias, copyright, etc. Organizing my files and folder is really helping me to find my files better.
