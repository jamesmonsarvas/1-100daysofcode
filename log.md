##### How to write code properly and indentation and know what is the meta tags.

**Today's Progress**: My first day of 100 Days of Code. I learn the basics of HTML and how to write code properly.

**Thoughts:** It's good to learn how to write code properly because when I was working I thought my HTML code is good but when I read some articles like in the down below, I have so many bad practices, that's why i'm so happy the I learn the best way and the clean way to write HTML code properly.
