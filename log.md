# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 20, 2018 (Learn the basic of HTML)
##### How to write code properly and indentation and know what is the meta tags.

**Today's Progress**: My first day of 100 Days of Code. I learn the basics of HTML and how to write code properly.

**Thoughts:** It's good to learn how to write code properly because when I was working I thought my HTML code is good but when I read some articles like in the down below, I have so many bad practices, that's why i'm so happy the I learn the best way and the clean way to write HTML code properly.

### Day 1: August 21, 2018 (Learn the basic of HTML)
##### How to organinze my files and folder. How to use header, main, footer, and aside.

**Today's Progress**: I learn how to organize my file and folder structure to my web page. I also learn how to use ```<header>```, ```<main>```, ```<footer>```, and ```<aside>``` and what is the purpose of these syntax. I use these syntax to specify my header, content, footer, and aside to my web page and also I add img folder to save all my images and use it to my web page.

**Thoughts:** ```<header>```, ```<main>```, ```<footer>``` is the main semantic element inside the body. ```<header>``` specifies the header of a document. It contains branding and navigation ```<main>``` specifies the main content of the document. ```<footer>``` specifies the footer of a document. It contains some navigation link, social medias, copyright, etc. Organizing my files and folder is really helping me to find my files better.

### Day 2: August 22, 2018 (Learn the basic of CSS, Grid system, and Flex)
##### Learning how to write css, compute 12 columns grid and how to use flex and also how to use Classes and ID's

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn some CSS basics and how to use Classes and ID's and how to compute 12 columns grid and how to use ```display: flex;``` to my grid system. This grid system that I created, I will use it to my Web page that I will create along the way. I also understand the purpose of normalize.css and I created the default css in my web page.

**Thoughts:** I'm still struggling in flexbox there's slightly I don't understant but overall, I feel like I am getting better at it. I also understand what is the purpose of Classes and ID's in my HTML Elements. I will still research and understand the CSS well.
