# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 20, 2018 (Learn the basic of HTML)
##### How to write code properly and indentation and know what is the meta tags.

**Today's Progress**: My first day of 100 Days of Code. I learn the basics of HTML and how to write code properly.

**Thoughts:** It's good to learn how to write code properly because when I was working I thought my HTML code is good but when I read some articles like in the down below, I have so many bad practices, that's why i'm so happy the I learn the best way and the clean way to write HTML code properly.

### Day 1: August 21, 2018 (Learn the basic of HTML)
##### How to organinze my files and folder. How to use header, main, footer, and aside.

**Today's Progress**: I learn how to organize my file and folder structure to my web page. I also learn how to use ```<header>```, ```<main>```, ```<footer>```, and ```<aside>``` and what is the purpose of these syntax. I use these syntax to specify my header, content, footer, and aside to my web page and also I add img folder to save all my images and use it to my web page.

**Thoughts:** ```<header>```, ```<main>```, ```<footer>``` is the main semantic element inside the body. ```<header>``` specifies the header of a document. It contains branding and navigation ```<main>``` specifies the main content of the document. ```<footer>``` specifies the footer of a document. It contains some navigation link, social medias, copyright, etc. Organizing my files and folder is really helping me to find my files better.

**Thoughts:** I'm still struggling in flexbox there's slightly I don't understant but overall, I feel like I am getting better at it. I also understand what is the purpose of Classes and ID's in my HTML Elements. I will still research and understand the CSS well.

### Day 5: August 25, 2018 (Learn the basic of JavaScript)
##### Learning and understanding the basic of JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn how to use JavaScript Function and what is the differences of JavaScript outputs and also how to declare variables, what is operator, arithmetic, data type and assignment.

**Thoughts:** There's a huge difference in JavaScript outputs. console.log is used for debugging, document.write is used for testing, innerHTML is used for displaying the value with HTML tag, innerText is used for displaying the text or value only so if you put some HTML tag it will display as well, and window.alert() or alert() is used for displaying alert box with specific message. Function is a great way to use if you have something you need to display, add, substract, to convert text to uppercase or lowercase, etc because you can always use it to your web pages. I also understand all the assignments operators and arithmetic operators.

### Day 11: September 6, 2018 (Array, Object and Loop)
##### How to combine array and object with input

**Today's Progress**: I learn today how to combine array and object using input and button, and I use loop to output the value of array and object.

**Thoughts:** At first, i'm struggling how to input some value to array using ```<input>``` tag. When I manage to input some data in my array, i'm surprise because it's only 1 line of code. It use only ```push()``` function so another idea comes up, that why I want to input some object into my array. And that's what I learn today.
