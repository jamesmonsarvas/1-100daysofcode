### Learning how to write css, compute 12 columns grid and how to use flex and also how to use Classes and ID's

**Today's Progress**: Today I learn some CSS basics and how to use Classes and ID's and how to compute 12 columns grid and how to use ```display: flex;``` to my grid system. This grid system that I created, I will use it to my Web page that I will create along the way. I also understand the purpose of normalize.css and I created the default css in my web page.
