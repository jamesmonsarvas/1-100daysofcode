# Day 13: December 18, 2018 (Learning Mobile First Responsive)
### Learn how to mobile first responsive

**Today's Progress**: Today I study and learn how to mobile first responsive. In first i'm struggling because for a very long time i'm a Desktop First before mobile so I didn't know what's the difference between ```min-width``` and ```max-width``` but now I think I understand the difference between the two.
