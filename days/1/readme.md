# Day 1: August 21, 2018 (Learn the basic of HTML)
### How to organinze my files and folder. How to use header, main, footer, and aside.

**Today's Progress**: I learn how to organize my file and folder structure to my web page. I also learn how to use ```<header>```, ```<main>```, ```<footer>```, and ```<aside>``` and what is the purpose of these syntax. I use these syntax to specify my header, content, footer, and aside to my web page and also I add img folder to save all my images and use it to my web page.
